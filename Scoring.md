Hi,
A couple of questions.

a. How are equal times/scores handled?
e.g:
1. tim 20seconds
1. tom 20seconds
3. ben 25seconds

b. Which order is the scoring
e.g:
1. 20pts
2. 19pts
3. 18pts

Is this consistent across all events?

Cheers,
Max

Ties received the same position and then it skips as in your example.

The order of scoring is correct in your example. The scoring order is consistent, but the amount will be different from some events (i.e. relays).
